# Targeted Value Calibration — Experiment Ledger

**Created:** 2026-06-26 · **Status:** active · **Scope:** the value-head calibration line of work (fix the black pre-drop overvalue without breaking the guardrail families).

A durable, append-only record of every value-calibration experiment: what changed, how it scored on the four acceptance gates, what we learned, and what **not** to retry. **Read this before proposing any new calibration knob** — if the change is on the [do-not-repeat](#do-not-repeat-prevents-going-in-circles) list (or another sweep of a knob we've already swept), the answer is probably "no, we already saw the tradeoff."

> **Key conclusion (2026-06-26):** Targeted **correction works** — we can pull the black pre-drop overvalue toward a hard target. But **scalar-MSE retention does not reliably preserve the guardrail families (B/C/D).** Uniform sampling, retention-weight sweeps, and global-weight sweeps have all failed. The next work (**v4**) should shift from scalar-row retention to **teacher-retention distillation** from the current best.

## How to read this

The work targets one known weakness — **A, black pre-drop overvalue** — while holding three fragile "guardrail" families steady: **B goal-line**, **C old broad post-opening**, **D red pre-drop**. Each experiment is scored at 400-sim probes against the current best's baselines.

Per family we track **mean** (mean black-perspective value), **over** (% of positions overvalued), and **severe** (% severely overvalued). On the overvalued families lower is better; the gate pass bars are below.

### The four gates (pass bars vs current best `calib020_0001`)

| Gate | Family | Baseline (current best) | **Pass criteria** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | black pre-drop (frozen-30, held out) | over 50.0% / severe 43.3% / mean +0.257 | mean ≤ 0.0 **and** severe materially below 43.3% |
| **B** | goal-line | over 5.6% / severe 0.0% | severe 0.0% **and** over ≤ 11.1% |
| **C** | old broad post-opening | over 33.3% / severe 13.3% / mean +0.099 | severe ≤ 13.3% **and** over ≤ 33.3% **and** mean ≤ +0.099 |
| **D** | red pre-drop | over 13.3% / severe 0.0% / mean −0.188 | severe = 0.0% **and** mean ≤ 0.0 |

**Promotion rule:** a checkpoint earns a **promotion match** (vs current best) only **after all four gates pass**. No branch below has earned one.

## Current best

**`calib020_0001`** — broad post-opening calibration from `0409`, selected early.

- Gate baselines (its own): A mean +0.257 / over 50.0% / severe 43.3% · B over 5.6% / severe 0.0% · C mean +0.099 / over 33.3% / severe 13.3% · D mean −0.188 / over 13.3% / severe 0.0%.
- **Match:** beat `0379` by **~+80 Elo**.
- **Decision: KEEP.** Strong overall, but a real **black pre-drop (A) weakness** — the thing every branch below tries to fix without breaking B/C/D.

## Experiment ledger

| Experiment | Main change (knobs) | A — black pre-drop | B — goal-line | C — old post-opening | D — red pre-drop | Match | Decision / lesson |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **calib010** — black-predrop v1 | Train **only** black-predrop correction, weight 0.01 | improved: over ~16–23%, severe ~6.7–10% | borderline / regressed | improved | regressed | Lost badly, **~−95 Elo** | **Reject.** Target fixed, broad play damaged. |
| **v2** — mixed pool | Correction + retention rows; retention_weight **0.5**, global **0.01**, **uniform** sampling | fixed A strongly | **fail** | **fail** | **hard fail** | no match | **Reject.** Correction worked, retention too weak. |
| **v2b** — mixed pool | v2 but retention_weight **2.0**, global 0.01 | fail/borderline @400: mean +0.038, severe 16.7% | **fail:** severe 5.6% | borderline fail: mean +0.109 | **fail:** severe 3.3% | no match | **Reject.** Stronger retention helped some; tradeoff remained. |
| **v3** — tag-stratified | Schedule **2:1:2:1**, retention_weight **1.0**, global 0.01 | **pass:** mean −0.047, severe 10.0% | **pass:** severe 0.0%, over 11.1% | **fail:** mean +0.180, over 40.0%, severe 23.3% | **fail:** severe 10.0% | no match | **Reject.** Stratification fixed mechanics + A/B, but C/D drifted. |
| **v3b** — tag-stratified, lower weight | Same schedule, global **0.005** | weak / fail-ish: mean −0.030, severe 20.0% | **fail:** severe 11.1% | **fail:** mean +0.113, severe 20.0% | **hard fail:** severe 23.3% | no match | **Reject.** Lower scalar weight didn't solve drift. **Stop scalar sweeps.** |

## What got better vs worse

**Improved — A (black pre-drop):** targeted correction is **real**. Best so far is **v3 @ global weight 0.01**: mean **−0.047**, severe **10.0%** (from baseline mean +0.257 / severe 43.3%).

**Worsened / unstable — C (old post-opening):** regresses under every v2/v3 approach. Crucially, **v3 and v3b share 5 severe C cases** — the same positions break regardless of the scalar weight:

- `game_000065_ply_021`
- `game_000309_ply_019`
- `game_000433_ply_029`
- `game_000505_ply_037`
- `game_000565_ply_033`

That overlap means **C is not random eval variance** — it's a stable fragile family that scalar calibration keeps damaging. It needs **direct retention of the current-best behavior** on those positions.

**Worsened / diffuse — D (red pre-drop):** v3/v3b share only **1** severe case:

- `red_loss_game_000728_predrop_ply_48_drop_50`

Low overlap ⇒ D is likely a **broader value-head drift** problem, not a handful of hard positions. A few hardcoded D rows probably won't fix it; it may need broader retention.

## Do-not-repeat (prevents going in circles)

1. **Uniform mixed-pool sampling only.** v2/v2b showed uniform sampling can't reliably separate correction from retention.
2. **Only increasing `retention_weight`.** v2b (2.0) helped some guardrails but weakened A and still failed. → no `retention_weight 3.0` sweep; we've already seen the tradeoff.
3. **Only lowering global calibration weight.** v3b (0.005) did not preserve guardrails and weakened correction. → **stop scalar weight sweeps.**
4. **Promotion matches before A/B/C/D all pass.** Every rejected branch failed gates clearly enough that a match would be wasted compute.
5. **More scalar-MSE-only rows as the main strategy.** The C/D failures show scalar row anchors aren't enough to hold the guardrails.

Also retired as *primary* strategies: global-weight sweeps, retention-weight sweeps, schedule-ratio sweeps. The next step is a new **design (v4)**, not a v3c re-tuning of the same knobs.

## Severe-overlap findings (why the next step changes shape)

- **C — stable repeat offenders:** 5 of the severe cases repeat across v3/v3b (listed above). C should be treated as a fixed fragile family needing **direct retention of current-best behavior**, not as eval noise.
- **D — diffuse:** only 1 shared severe case across v3/v3b. D reads as **broad value-head drift**; unlikely to be solved by adding a few hard D rows.

## Next planned hypothesis — v4: Teacher-Retention Anchors

Shift retention from "match a frozen **scalar** target" to "**match the current-best teacher's output**" on the guardrail positions — explicitly preserving current-best behavior on B/C/D instead of approximating it with a scalar.

**Core idea**
- **Correction rows:** hard-target MSE (e.g. `black_predrop_correction` target = −0.35) — unchanged.
- **Retention rows:** the candidate should **match the frozen `calib020_0001` teacher output** on those positions.

**Minimum v4 — value teacher retention:** candidate value MSE to the teacher's value on B/C/D retention rows.

**Potential v4+ — value + policy teacher retention:** candidate value MSE to teacher value **and** candidate policy KL to the teacher policy/prior on retention rows.

**Where each likely matters:**
- **C** failures have **high top-1 confidence** ⇒ **policy retention** may matter (hold the move distribution, not just the value).
- **D** failures are **low top-1 / diffuse** ⇒ **value retention** may matter more.

> **Conclusion to carry into v4 design:** targeted correction works, but scalar-MSE retention does not preserve guardrails reliably. v4 = **teacher-retention distillation** from the current best.
