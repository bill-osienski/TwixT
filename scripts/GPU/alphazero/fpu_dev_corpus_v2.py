"""FPU (policy-mass) v2 phase-primary development-corpus builder.

Frozen design ref: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-fpu-dev-corpus-v2-phase-design.md
v2 plan Task 1 ("v2 constants + classifiers") -- this task.

Successor to `build_fpu_dev_corpus.py` (v1), which stratified by branching
BAND with a <=50%-ply-bucket cap -- proved mathematically impossible on the
project's fixed 24x24 board (design Sec 0; encoded permanently as
`tests/test_fpu_dev_corpus_v2.py::test_v1_bands_impossible_on_24board`,
Task 0). v2 makes game PHASE the primary stratum (design Sec 1.2) and
demotes branching band to a recorded covariate plus explicit late coverage
floors (design Sec 1.3) -- band is no longer an independent quota stratum.

=============================================================================
PURE SECTION (Task 1) -- constants + pure functions ONLY.
=============================================================================
Mirrors build_fpu_dev_corpus.py's own PURE SECTION / OPERATOR SHELL split.
Everything in this file is pure at this task: plain-stdlib constants and one
pure classifier. NO MCTS / evaluator / GPU / MLX / heavy-numpy imports, no
I/O, no argument parsing. Later tasks append BELOW this section, in order:
  Task 2: `enumerate_v2_proposals` -- phase-aware side-opposed proposal
    enumerator (no global stride).
  Task 3: the phase-stratified sampler (with late floors).
  Task 4: the v2 geometric preflight.
  Task 5: the operator `screen` stage (evaluator/MCTS; lazy heavy imports).
  Task 6: the pure `select` stage + config loader + `main`.
Keep this section cleanly separated and importable without ever triggering a
GPU/MLX import -- any future heavy import goes lazily inside the Task-5
operator functions, exactly as build_fpu_dev_corpus.py's own `main` /
`_build_anchor_search_fn` / evaluator plumbing do.

What this section does
-----------------------
Frozen phase-primary constants (design Sec 1.2 / 1.3 / 1.5) plus the one v2
classifier, `proposal_cell_of`, which maps a (phase, n_legal) pair to its
PROPOSAL_CELLS membership -- or to a cell deliberately NOT in PROPOSAL_CELLS
(a `("late", None)` sentinel for sub-200 late positions is intentionally
ineligible; see `proposal_cell_of`'s own docstring). DRY: reuses `band_of`,
and re-exports the shared v1 MIN_PLY_GAP / MAX_PER_GAME / SIDE_TOL
constants, from `build_fpu_dev_corpus` rather than restating them -- see
each import's inline comment for why.
